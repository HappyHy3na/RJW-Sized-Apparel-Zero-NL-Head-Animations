This is a VERY MAKESHIFT mod at the moment, so don't expect it to work too well. The two folders from this repository are the original [NL] facial animation as well as the vanilla expanded retexture mod that have been altered to barely manage to have the heads, eyes, and mouthes to render. None of the heads apply to a spesific gene or anything at the moment but I plan on getting that to work in the future. Any and all help is apreciated with this project since I have no knowledge how to properly code.
